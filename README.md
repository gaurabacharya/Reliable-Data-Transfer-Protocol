To achieve these expectations, we'll need to implement a reliable data transfer protocol over UDP with congestion control and flow control mechanisms. Here's an outline of how we can approach this:

1. **Packet Structure**: Define a packet structure that includes sequence numbers, acknowledgment numbers, checksums, and data payload.

2. **Sender Implementation (`rsend`)**:
   - Split the file into chunks.
   - Implement a sliding window mechanism to control the number of unacknowledged packets.
   - Use selective repeat ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest) to handle lost packets.
   - Implement congestion control mechanisms like slow start and congestion avoidance using algorithms like TCP Tahoe or TCP Reno.
   - Calculate and verify checksums for data integrity.
   - Handle flow control based on receiver's acknowledgment window size.
   - Send packets using UDP sockets.

3. **Receiver Implementation (`rrecv`)**:
   - Receive packets using UDP sockets.
   - Implement a sliding window for receiving and buffering packets.
   - Send acknowledgments for received packets and handle duplicate acknowledgments.
   - Write received data to the destination file with consideration of the write rate limit.
   - Signal the sender to adjust transmission rate based on flow control.
   - Calculate and verify checksums for data integrity.

4. **Main Functions**:
   - Implement main functions in sender.c and receiver.c to handle command-line arguments and invoke the data transfer operations.

5. **Testing and Evaluation**:
   - Test the protocol under different network conditions, including dropped packets and varying bandwidth.
   - Evaluate the protocol's performance against the provided expectations (E1-E8), ensuring fairness, throughput, and adherence to flow control.

In further detail:

### 1. Packet Structure:
Define a packet structure that includes fields for sequence number, acknowledgment number, checksum, and data payload.

```c
struct Packet {
    unsigned int seq_num;
    unsigned int ack_num;
    unsigned int checksum;
    char data[MAX_DATA_SIZE];
};
```

### 2. Sender Implementation (`rsend`):
Here's an outline of steps to implement `rsend`:

#### a. Split the file into chunks:
   - Read the file in chunks of a certain size.

#### b. Sliding Window Mechanism:
   - Maintain a sender window to control the number of unacknowledged packets.
   - Update the window based on acknowledgments received.

#### c. Selective Repeat ARQ:
   - Retransmit packets that are not acknowledged within a certain timeout period.

#### d. Congestion Control:
   - Implement slow start and congestion avoidance algorithms.
   - Adjust the sender window size based on congestion signals.

#### e. Flow Control:
   - Monitor receiver's acknowledgment window size.
   - Adjust transmission rate based on receiver's flow control signals.

#### f. UDP Socket Communication:
   - Send packets using UDP sockets.

### 3. Receiver Implementation (`rrecv`):
Here's an outline of steps to implement `rrecv`:

#### a. Receiving and Buffering:
   - Receive packets using UDP sockets.
   - Buffer received packets in a receive window.

#### b. Sending Acknowledgments:
   - Send acknowledgments for received packets.
   - Handle duplicate acknowledgments.

#### c. Writing to Destination File:
   - Write received data to the destination file.
   - Respect the write rate limit specified.

#### d. Signaling Flow Control:
   - Signal the sender to adjust transmission rate based on flow control.

#### e. UDP Socket Communication:
   - Receive packets and send acknowledgments using UDP sockets.

### 4. Main Functions:
Implement main functions in sender.c and receiver.c to handle command-line arguments and invoke the data transfer operations.

### 5. Testing and Evaluation:
Test the protocol under different network conditions, including dropped packets and varying bandwidth. Evaluate the protocol's performance against the provided expectations (E1-E8).
